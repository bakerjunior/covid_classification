In this project I compare the performance of the KNNs (K-nearest neighbors) algorithm with that of a simple neural network on a binary classification of death/recovery from COVID-19.

Classification is based off of patient data such as age, gender, symptoms, geographic data etc.
The dataset was provided by through the University and I am unsure of its origin otherwise.
